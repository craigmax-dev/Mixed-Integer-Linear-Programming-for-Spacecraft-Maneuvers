# Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming-for-Spacecraft-Maneuvers

This project implements a model for Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Spacecraft Maneuvers from the paper by Richards et al,
[Spacecraft Trajectory Planning with Avoidance Constraints Using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.4943).

This project requires the [IBM CPLEX optimizer](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer).

Further improvements and information to be implemented shortly.
